Icon File Instructions
=====================

For PHP Desktop, you need an .ico file for the application icon.

To create an icon:
1. Create or find a 256x256 PNG image for your library system
2. Convert it to .ico format using online tools like:
   - https://convertio.co/png-ico/
   - https://www.icoconverter.com/
3. Save as "icon.ico" in this assets folder
4. The phpdesktop-config.json already references "assets/icon.ico"

Suggested icon themes:
- Book with computer/digital elements
- Library building
- School logo with books
- Graduation cap with books

The icon will appear in:
- Application window title bar
- Windows taskbar
- Desktop shortcut (if created)
- Windows Alt+Tab switcher
